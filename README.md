# Concert Management System

## Overview

The Concert Management System is a Python application that allows users to manage bands, venues, and concerts using a SQLite database. The application provides functionalities to add data, retrieve information about performances, and analyze relationships between bands and venues.

## Features

- **Manage Bands**: Create and store information about bands, including their name and hometown.
- **Manage Venues**: Create and store information about concert venues, including their title and city.
- **Concert Management**: Link bands and venues through concert records with specified dates.
- **Data Retrieval**: Fetch related data, such as:
  - Concerts performed by a band.
  - Venues where a band has performed.
  - Bands that have performed at a specific venue.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Determine which band has performed the most and which band frequently plays at a venue.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- SQLite (included with Python standard library)

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/concert-management.git
   cd concert-management
   ```

2. Ensure Python is installed on your machine. Check by running:

   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

### Usage

1. Open the `concert_management.py` file in your preferred code editor.
2. The main section of the code contains sample data. You can modify it to add your own bands, venues, and concerts.
3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python concert_management.py
   ```

### Class Descriptions

#### Band Class

- **`__init__(self, band_id)`**: Initializes a Band instance with its ID.
- **`concerts()`**: Returns a list of concerts the band has performed in, including venue details.
- **`venues()`**: Returns a list of venues where the band has performed.
- **`play_in_venue(venue_title, date)`**: Adds a new concert for the band at the specified venue on the provided date.
- **`all_introductions()`**: Returns a list of introduction strings for all concerts by the band.
- **`most_performances()`**: Static method that returns the band with the highest number of performances.

#### Venue Class

- **`__init__(self, venue_id)`**: Initializes a Venue instance with its ID.
- **`concerts()`**: Returns a list of concerts held at the venue, along with band details.
- **`bands()`**: Returns a list of unique bands that have performed at the venue.
- **`concert_on(date)`**: Finds the first concert on a specific date at the venue.
- **`most_frequent_band()`**: Returns the band that has performed the most at the venue.

#### Concert Class

- **`__init__(self, concert_id)`**: Initializes a Concert instance with its ID.
- **`hometown_show()`**: Returns `True` if the concert is in the band's hometown, otherwise `False`.
- **`introduction()`**: Returns an introduction string for the band performing at the concert.

## Example Output

When running the application, you might see outputs like:

```
Hometown Show: True
Concert Introduction: Hello London!!!!! We are The Beatles and we're from Liverpool
Concerts at Venue: [(1, 'The Beatles', '2023-10-01')]
Bands at Venue: [(1, 'The Beatles')]
Band Introductions: ["Hello New York!!!!! We are The Beatles and we're from Liverpool"]
Most Performances Band: (1, 'The Beatles', 1)
Most Frequent Band at Venue: (1, 'The Beatles', 1)
```

## Conclusion

This Concert Management System provides a simple yet effective way to manage bands, venues, and concerts while demonstrating the use of raw SQL queries in Python. You can extend this project by adding more features, such as a user interface or web-based API.
